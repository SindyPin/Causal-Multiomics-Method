### **2. Framework**
This section describes the integrative framework developed for causal gene discovery.

- **Subsections:**
  - **Overview:** Explanation of key framework components: instrumental variables (SNPs), exposure (gene expression), and outcome (Long COVID phenotypes).
  - **Mendelian Randomization (MR):**
    - Implementation using the Mt-Robin method.
    - Steps include data pre-processing, forward selection analysis, mixed model setup, statistical validation, and output processing.
    - Formulas for key metrics (e.g., MR score normalization).

  - **Control Theory (CT):**
    - Application of Controllability Analysis (CA) to identify critical genes.
    - Node classification (Type I and Type II) and network metrics.
    - Integration of MR and CT results to prioritize genes.

  - **Figures:**
    - **Figure 2:** Mendelian Randomization framework.
    - **Figure 3:** Multi-omics framework integrating MR, RNA-seq, and PPI data.

### **4. Gene Expression Clustering**
This section details the clustering methodology applied to gene expression data.
- **Steps:**
  - Preprocessing, scaling, and parameter optimization.
  - Use of hierarchical clustering (hc) and Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM).
  - Output generation, including cluster assignments and visualization.
- **Statistical Tests:**
  - Chi-squared test for large samples.
  - Fisherâ€™s Exact Test for small samples.

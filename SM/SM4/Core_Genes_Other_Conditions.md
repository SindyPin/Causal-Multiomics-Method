# Core Genes in Other Similar Conditions:

## Overview
This dataset explores the involvement of the core causal genes we found for Long-COVID in other pathophysiological conditions. It integrates data curated from multiple disease databases, providing comprehensive insights into gene-condition associations and their potential relevance to Long-COVID.

## Dataset Contents
The **Core_Genes_Other_Conditions.xlsx** file contains three sheets, each providing specific information about the relationships between genes, conditions, and the databases used for curation:

1. **AllGenesConditions**:
   - This sheet lists each gene alongside the specific pathophysiological conditions they are associated with and the database that identifies the association. It provides a foundational view of the core genes and their relevance to various diseases.
   - **Columns**:
     - **Gene**: The gene symbol.
     - **Conditions**: The name of the condition(s) associated with the gene.
     - **Database**: The database that identifies the association between the gene and the condition.

2. **GenesConditionsLCV**:
   - This sheet offers a detailed view of each gene's association with overlapping conditions. For each gene, all known conditions are aggregated and listed, providing a broader perspective on the gene's potential involvement in various pathologies. This comprehensive mapping highlights overlapping disease mechanisms.
   - **Columns**:
     - **Gene**: The gene symbol.
     - **Conditions**: A comprehensive list of all conditions associated with each gene and overlapped with Long COVID, aggregated into a single field.

3. **Databases**:
   - This sheet contains information about the databases used in the analysis. Each database is listed by name along with a direct link, allowing users to explore the data sources for further details.
   - **Columns**:
     - **Name**: The name of the database.
     - **Link**: A direct URL to the database's website or search page.
